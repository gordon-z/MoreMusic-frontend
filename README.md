Frontend hosted on GitHub pages. Backend Django app and Postgres DB hosted on Render. 

If link displays correctly but isn't able to login/create/delete recommendations, it's likely because application is hosted on Render's free tier, which automatically expires free applications after a certain time.

## From Render: Your free instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more.

If requests take a long time to complete, this is why.
